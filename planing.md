## What should I predict?

temperature, pressure and moisture

## OR What do I need?

- Humidity
- Radar?
- dew point, cloud cover, sea level air pressure, wind speed and direction

    - air temperature, atmospheric (barometric) pressure, humidity, precipitation, solar radiation and wind.




## Evaluation of the model:
- Error
- Accuracy
- uncertainty analysis?
- 


## The plan:
    1. EDA for Temperature and some features
    2. Simple LSTM and evaluation (plot it)
    3. Multivariate LSTM and evaluation (plot it)
    4. SARIMA and evaluation (plot it)
    5. Prophet and evaluation (plot it)
    6. Web-App
